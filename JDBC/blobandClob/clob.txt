Writh1Q test code for the Shttp[eUoi'ColM class
We need to write test code that can make a SimpleDotCom object
and run its methods. For the SimpleDotCom class. we really
care about only the cMckYourselj() method, although we will have
to implement the sdLocatiun~l1s()method in order to get the
cMckYourself() method to run correctly.
Take a good look at the prepcode below for the checkYourselj()
method (the setLocaticmCells() method is a no-brainer setter method,
so we're not worried about it. but in a 'real' application we might
wan I a more robust 'setter' method. which we wouldwant to test).
Then ask yourself, "If the checkYourselfO method were
implemented. what test code could I write that would prove to me
the method is working correctly?"
'ased Ott this prepcode:
METHOD String checkYourselffString userCuess)
GET the user guess as a String parameter
CONVERT the user guess to an Int
REPEAT with each of the location cells in the Int array
/I COMPARf the user guessto the location cell
IF the user guess matches
INCREMENT the number of hits
/ / FIND OUT if it was the last location cell:
IF number of hits is 3.RETURN "Kill" asthe result
ELSE it was not a kill, so RETURN"Hif'
END IF
ELSE the user guess did not match, so RETURN "Miss"
END IF
END REPEAT
END METHOD
